My name is Faith, and I am an avid reader and passionate settlement counsellor with years of experience working in the nonprofit sector, particularly with newcomer women and girls. My journey has always been about empowering others, and recently, I have decided to channel that energy into the world of cybersecurity. What led me here? The growing need for cybersecurity professionals and the challenge of protecting systems and data in an increasingly digital world inspired me to pivot my career. I’ve always been drawn to problem-solving and helping people navigate challenges, and I see cybersecurity as a natural extension of that passion.

After completing an accelerated cybersecurity course, I have developed a strong foundation in identifying, analyzing, and mitigating threats such as malware, DDoS attacks, and social engineering. What excites me most about the field is its dynamic nature — there's always something new to learn and opportunities to make a real impact. I am currently pursuing a Cybersecurity diploma at AltSchool Africa’s School of Engineering. The journey has been intense and challenging, but it has also proven to be immensely rewarding.

My long-term goal is to specialize in cybersecurity solutions for nonprofit organizations, helping them safeguard sensitive data and ensure continuity in their crucial work. I’m also deeply interested in helping underserved communities understand cybersecurity risks and how to protect themselves.

I’m excited to connect with professionals in the cybersecurity industry and learn from your experiences. Whether you’re a fellow career changer, a seasoned expert, or someone exploring opportunities, I’d love to engage and exchange ideas. Let’s work together to make the digital world a safer place!

Feel free to connect or share insights — I’m eager to grow my network and contribute to this exciting field 😊
